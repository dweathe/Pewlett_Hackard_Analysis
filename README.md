# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis isto assist an up and coming HR Analyst, Bobby, who needs to find answers for Pewlett Hackard (PH), regarding two questions:

1.  Who will be retiring in the next few years?
2.  How many positions will PH need to fill once the empolyees in question 1 retire?

This analysis will help 'future proof' PH by helping Bobby build an employee database in SQL through use of my engineering, modeling and analysis skills.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
